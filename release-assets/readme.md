# Note

This tool has not been signed and therefore windows will often block it, sometimes even _without_ any error message. 

If this happens, you have to unblock it:

1. right click on the exe
2. open properties
3. if blocked there is a security message in the lower part
4. mark the checkbox "allow"

The file is save. The complete sourcecoude is on GitHub:
